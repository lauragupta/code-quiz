# code-quiz

This project is a fun way for people to test their coding knowledge with a short quiz to test some basic coding knowledge. I used lots of functions and methods in the JavaScript including setting 2 different types of timers, several event listeners for different events, and loops. Also, the quiz keeps your scores saved using local storage, so you can try over and over to beat your score.
